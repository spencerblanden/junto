Google is great but sometimes googling just creates a mess. Where do you go when you need input, ideas, or support for your projects? Junto is the endpoint of all your coding questions. In 1727 Ben Franklin started The Junto, a writing group aimed at helping the members make self-improvements. The literal definition is- “a group of persons joined for a common purpose.” In 2021 Junto is being re-established as a social forum for developer collaboration. Junto is a collaborative space for developers to pin, tag, share, and find useful bits to add to their coding repertoire- including everything from simple CSS techniques, CDN tutorials, background images, to memes.
